# Scholarly Arcana
## Progression
### Exploration
At the start, the only resource available to the player would be zinc<sup>or not</sup>, allowing them to craft the research table and metallurgical foundry. The first research they can access would be the basics of the Weave, unlocked after finding a structure that generates in the world, with a stabilized "Weave tear" in the center&mdash;touching (via right click) or stepping into the tear would unlock the research.
### Research
The mechanics of research start out with just supplying paper (consumed) and feather and ink sacs (not consumed) to a research table, and clicking to unlock available research. After progressing in the mod, research would become more complex, requiring items and maybe a minigame (TBD).
### Interfacing with the Weave
Now that the player has researched the Weave, and has access to brass, they can craft their first essence extractor and essence vials&mdash;allowing them to extract essence of the 4 basic elements out of water, air, fire, and earth (stone).  
With that, they can power their first machines.

At this stage, the player will also learn about Weave crafting&mdash;throwing an item into a Weave tear to imbue it with magical properties.
* Weave crafting recipe: Arcane Brasswork Gear, Arcane Device Housing

An automatable version of the essence extractor would also be able to be crafted, consuming coal (or steam?) to produce essence out of the block in front of them.

More to be added.
### Spellcraft
With essence in hand, the player will be able to craft spells, using a scroll inscription table.  
5x5 crafting grid + parchment input and output slot. Parchment is made from leather [through some process], and a 5x5 pattern using arcane ink defines the spell scroll created (arcane ink is created via Weave crafting of ink sacs, essence, and gem dust [made with a grinding machine], 5 tiers of rarity based on the gem and research level [redstone, lapis, amethyst, emerald, diamond]).  
To copy a spell scroll into a spellbook, the scroll itself and some ink one rarity tier higher is needed (process to copy highest tier spell TBD)

Spellcasting consumes essence, and cannot be done in armor. The Mage Armor spell and wizard robes are added to protect the spellcaster, and enhance their spellcasting ability.
## Miscellaneous
### Automation
The mod is designed to be vanilla automation friendly and mod automation friendly, with full usage of capabilities and additional devices to facilitate automation:
* A machine to spread fire from netherrack, to allow complete automation of fire essence
* The ability to open miniature Weave tears
### Other additions
* A tank to store essence in
* Different variants of wizard robes, emphasizing protection vs spellcasting ability.
* Mobs and bosses?
* Magic items and trinkets!
