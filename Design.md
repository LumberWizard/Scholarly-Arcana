# Scholarly Arcana
## Progression
### Exploration
To start, the player must find a structure that generates in the world, with a stabilized "Weave tear" in the center&mdash;touching (via right click) or stepping into the tear would unlock the research for said structure.
### Research
To progress in the mod, the player would have to research different concepts, using a research table. To make a certain topic available to unlock, the player must discover or create certain things from the mod, or from vanilla Minecraft.
The mechanics of research start out with just supplying paper (consumed) and feather and ink sacs (not consumed) to a research table, and simply clicking to unlock available research. After progressing in the mod, research would become more complex, requiring items and maybe a minigame (TBD).
### Interfacing with the Weave
Now that the player has researched the Weave, they can gain access to Weave crafting (explained below), and brass, made by smelting sand and raw copper ore in a basic magical foundry in the vicinity of a Weave tear. With that, they can craft their first essence extractor and essence vials&mdash;allowing them to extract essence of the 4 basic elements out of water, air, fire, and earth (stone).  
Once they have that, they can power their first machines.

**Weave crafting**: throwing an item into a Weave tear to imbue it with magical properties.
* Weave crafting recipe: Arcane Brasswork Gear, Arcane Device Housing

An automatable version of the essence extractor would also be able to be crafted, consuming coal (or steam?) to produce essence out of the block in front of them.

More to be added.
### Spellcraft
With essence in hand, the player will be able to craft spells, using a scroll inscription table.  
5x5 crafting grid + parchment input and output slot. Parchment is made from leather [through some process], and a 5x5 pattern using arcane ink defines the spell scroll created (arcane ink is created via Weave crafting of ink sacs, essence, and gem dust [made with a grinding machine/mill/TBD], 5 tiers of rarity based on the gem and research level [redstone, lapis, amethyst, emerald, diamond]).  
To copy a spell scroll into a spellbook, the scroll itself and some ink one rarity tier higher is needed (process to copy highest tier spell TBD)

Spellcasting consumes essence, and cannot be done in armor. The Mage Armor spell and wizard robes are added to protect the spellcaster, and enhance their spellcasting ability.
### Further Progress (proper name TBD)
Using all four types of essence to extract raw magic essence out of a Weave tear. Raw essence would be used for machines and devices that interface with the Weave directly, rather than induce physical phenomena with elemental essence.
## Miscellaneous
### Automation and Machines
The mod is designed to be vanilla automation friendly and mod automation friendly, with full usage of capabilities and additional devices to facilitate automation:
* A machine to spread fire from netherrack, to allow complete automation of fire essence
* The ability to open miniature Weave tears
* An enhanced magical foundry that uses fire essence to smelt blast furnace recipes at an even faster rate, as well as basic magical foundry recipes.
* Bellows to be used with air essence to accelerate said foundry.
### Other additions (not necessarily tied to progression)
* A tank to store essence in
* Different variants of wizard robes, emphasizing protection vs spellcasting ability.
* Mobs and bosses?
* Magic items and trinkets!
